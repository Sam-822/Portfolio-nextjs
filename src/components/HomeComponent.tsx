            My extensive project experience, as described in the projects
            section, has honed my problem-solving skills and equipped me with
            the ability to create dynamic, responsive web applications.
            Additionally, my backend knowledge in technologies like NodeJS and
            ExpressJS complements my frontend skills, allowing me to contribute
            to full-stack development projects effectively.
